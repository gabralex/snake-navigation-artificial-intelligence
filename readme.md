# Artificial intelligence driven navigation for worlds based on the classic Snake game

A investigation of the applicability of artificial intelligence driven navigation for worlds based on the classic [snake] game. The
intent is to substitute a human agent with an artificial agent that would act and navigate under the same constrains, whilst
out-preforming the human agent in terms of the following:
- Optimal long term navigation behaviour
- Shorter response times to environmental changes
- Better comprehension and retention of large environment layouts
